# 3D Computer Vision Projects

A comprehensive collection of 3D computer vision projects using Open3D, OpenCV, and Intel RealSense for point cloud processing, plane detection, and real-time object detection.

## Features

- **Point Cloud Processing**: Loading, downsampling, normal estimation, and plane segmentation
- **Image Processing**: Color-based segmentation, contour detection, and convex hull finding
- **Plane Detection**: SVD-based plane fitting and angle calculation
- **Real-time 3D Detection**: RealSense-based blue cube detection with depth information
- **3D Transformations**: Rotation matrices and coordinate transformations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-Computer-Vision-Projects.git
cd 3D-Computer-Vision-Projects
